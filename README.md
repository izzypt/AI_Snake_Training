### <ins>Reinforcement Learning (RL) </ins>

RL is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environemnt in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

Put it simply, RL is : teaching a software agent how to behave in an environment by telling it how well it is doing.

### <ins> Deep Q Learning </ins>

This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network to predict the actions.
